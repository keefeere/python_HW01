# Calculator Program by KeeFeeRe

This program allows the user to perform simple arithmetic operations on two numbers. The program asks the user to choose an operation from the following options:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

Then the program asks the user to enter two numbers that will be used for the chosen operation. The program checks if the entered numbers are valid, and if not, it repeats the request. The program also allows the user to exit the program by pressing Ctrl+C.

After the user enters two valid numbers, the program performs the chosen operation and displays the result on the screen. The program formats the result so that if it is an integer, it is displayed without a decimal point, and if it is a float, it has six digits after the point. The program also tries to handle possible errors, such as division by zero, overflow, or NaN (not a number), and displays an appropriate error message.
